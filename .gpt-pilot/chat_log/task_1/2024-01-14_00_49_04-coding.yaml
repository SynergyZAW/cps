  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: 'You are working on a App called "ABM" and you need to write code for the entire app based on the tasks that the
    tech lead gives you. So that you understand better what you''re working on, you''re given other specs for "ABM" as well.


    Here is a high level description of "ABM":

    ```

    Development of a Basic Agent-Based Model (ABM) named "ABM" will be undertaken to simulate the South African cannabis and
    hemp industry using Streamlit. This basic version will feature two types of agents: Farmers (formal and informal) with
    attributes like production capacity and compliance status, and Regulators who affect market conditions and policies. The
    interactions will allow Farmers to respond to market conditions and Regulators to implement policies.


    The simulation will run over a timeframe of two years per execution and is designed for a single user without support
    for multiple simultaneous users. The Streamlit interface will enable user input for parameters such as market demand and
    regulatory conditions through sliders or input fields. Users can control the simulation with start, stop, and reset buttons.


    Data visualization will present results through graphs or tables, showcasing key outputs like total production and compliance
    levels. However, no feedback mechanism for user input is required for this application.


    Development guidelines include maintaining a clean, well-documented codebase, ensuring user-friendliness, and prioritizing
    quick loading and smooth interaction. Codebase documentation will consist of an overview, in-code comments, descriptive
    docstrings, a comprehensive README file, API documentation (if applicable), a change log or version control messages,
    testing documentation, deployment instructions, coding standards, and future development notes.


    The implementation does not require the collection of historical data input from users since default values for the simulation
    parameters will be provided, which users can adjust. Design should account for scalability for eventual enhancement with
    more complex features.

    ```



    Here are user stories that specify how users use "ABM":

    ```


    - User will input parameters for market demand and regulatory conditions using sliders or input fields in the Streamlit
    interface.


    - User will start the simulation by clicking the ''start'' button in the Streamlit interface.


    - User will stop the ongoing simulation by clicking the ''stop'' button in the Streamlit interface.


    - User will reset the simulation to initial conditions by clicking the ''reset'' button in the Streamlit interface.


    - User will observe the total production output through graphs or tables within the Streamlit interface.


    - User will assess compliance levels of the Farmers through visualizations in the Streamlit interface.


    ```



    Here are the technologies that you need to use for this project:

    ```


    - Streamlit


    - Python


    - Pandas


    - numpy


    - matplotlib


    - altair


    - Git


    ```






    We''ve broken the development of this app down to these tasks:

    ```

    1. Set up a basic Streamlit app with a simple interface that has placeholder elements for user inputs (sliders and input
    fields), control buttons (start, stop, reset), and placeholders for visualizing outputs (graphs and tables).


    2. Develop the ABM simulation engine in Python using classes to define Farmers and Regulators with their attributes and
    methods for their behaviors and interactions.


    3. Integrate the ABM simulation engine with the Streamlit app, connecting user inputs to the simulation parameters and
    enabling the control buttons to start, stop, and reset the simulation.


    4. Implement data visualization for total production output and compliance levels using matplotlib and altair for graphs,
    and pandas for data manipulation.


    5. Conduct a stream of beta tests of the entire Streamlit app through iterative development cycles to ensure all parts
    work together smoothly, iron out any bugs and enhance the user interface based on feedback.


    ```


    You are currently working on task #1 with the following description:

    ```

    Set up a basic Streamlit app with a simple interface that has placeholder elements for user inputs (sliders and input
    fields), control buttons (start, stop, reset), and placeholders for visualizing outputs (graphs and tables).

    ```


    After all the code is finished, a human developer will check if the app works this way - `Ensure the Streamlit app launches
    with the defined elements visible and accessible, even if they are non-functional.`


    Now, tell me all the code that needs to be written to implement ONLY this task and have it fully working and all commands
    that need to be run to implement this task.


    **IMPORTANT**

    When you think about in which file should the new code go to, always try to make files as small as possible and put code
    in more smaller files rather than in one big file. Whenever a file becomes too large (more than 50 lines of code) split
    it into smaller files.


    **IMPORTANT**

    Remember, I created an empty folder where I will start writing files that you tell me and that are needed for this app.

    You do not need to make any automated tests work.


    DO NOT specify commands to create any folders or files, they will be created automatically - just specify the relative
    path to each file that needs to be written.


    Never use the port 5000 to run the app, it''s reserved.'

  content: "To set up a basic Streamlit app with the specified interface elements for Task #1, we will need to construct the\
    \ primary Streamlit script and organize our code into small, modular files. Let's start by separating our interface elements\
    \ into different Python files.\n\nCreate the following files:\n\n`/streamlit_app.py` (main file to run the Streamlit app):\n\
    \n```python\nimport streamlit as st\nfrom interface import user_input, control_buttons, output_placeholders\n\ndef main():\n\
    \    # Show User Input Section\n    user_input.show()\n\n    # Show Control Buttons\n    control_buttons.show()\n\n  \
    \  # Show Output Placeholders\n    output_placeholders.show()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n`/interface/user_input.py`\
    \ (file for user input related elements):\n\n```python\nimport streamlit as st\n\ndef show():\n    st.sidebar.header(\"\
    User Inputs\")\n    # Placeholder slider and input fields\n    market_demand = st.sidebar.slider('Market Demand', min_value=0,\
    \ max_value=100, value=50)\n    regulatory_conditions = st.sidebar.text_input('Regulatory Conditions', \"\")\n    \n \
    \   # Ideally, these values would be connected to the simulation engine.\n```\n\n`/interface/control_buttons.py` (file\
    \ for the simulation control buttons):\n\n```python\nimport streamlit as st\n\ndef show():\n    st.header(\"Simulation\
    \ Control\")\n    start_btn = st.button('Start')\n    stop_btn = st.button('Stop')\n    reset_btn = st.button('Reset')\n\
    \n    # These buttons should be connected to the simulation actions.\n```\n\n`/interface/output_placeholders.py` (file\
    \ for placeholders for visualizing outputs):\n\n```python\nimport streamlit as st\n\ndef show():\n    st.header(\"Simulation\
    \ Output\")\n\n    # Placeholder for total production output graph\n    st.subheader(\"Total Production Output\")\n  \
    \  st.write(\"Graph placeholder\")\n\n    # Placeholder for compliance levels graph/table\n    st.subheader(\"Compliance\
    \ Levels\")\n    st.write(\"Graph/Table placeholder\")\n```\n\nTo make the application functional, you need to run the\
    \ Streamlit server. Open a terminal and run the Streamlit app using this command (assuming you have Streamlit installed):\n\
    \n```bash\nstreamlit run streamlit_app.py\n```\n\nEnsure that Streamlit is installed in your Python environment; if not,\
    \ you can install it using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install streamlit\n```\n\nPlease note that the app we're setting up is\
    \ still non-functional with placeholder elements that we will connect in future tasks. The framework we've set up consists\
    \ of the main `streamlit_app.py` script that calls modular functions from our `/interface/` directory, keeping the codebase\
    \ clean and organized.\n\nLaunching the app with the command provided will start a Streamlit server (on a default port,\
    \ which is typically 8501), and the app should be visible in a web browser window. The elements must be visible and accessible\
    \ even if they have no back-end functionality for this task."
