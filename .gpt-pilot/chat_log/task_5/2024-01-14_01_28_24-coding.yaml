- role: system
  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: "Here is how the file `/simulation/session_state_debugger.py/` looks like right now:\n```\n\n```\n\nAnd here is\
    \ the new implementation for the same file:\n```\nfrom simulation_state import simulation_state\nimport streamlit as st\n\
    \n\ndef debug_session_state():\n    try:\n        # [OLD CODE] Check and validate simulation state maintenance across\
    \ reruns\n    except Exception as e:\n        st.error('Session state debugging failed: {}'.format(e))\n        # INPUT_REQUIRED\
    \ {Specify a recovery or reporting mechanism for session state errors}\n\n```\n\nNow, implement the new changes into the\
    \ previously implemented file and return the entirely coded file. Do not add any lines of code that are not in the previously\
    \ coded file or the new implementation but only combine those two.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nAll lines of code in the new implementation\
    \ should be present. From the old implementation, only take the ones that are replaced with the comment `[OLD CODE]` in\
    \ the new implementation\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nMake sure that you respond with all lines of code that are replaced by these\
    \ comments, including all control structures, error handling, and any other relevant logic that was in the original code.\n\
    Under no circumstances should you ever leave any part of the code snippet unwritten. Every single line of code that exists\
    \ in the place where the comment lives right now should be replaced. Do not include any code that is above or below the\
    \ comment but only the code that should be in the position of the comment."
