  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: "You are working on a App called \"ABM\" and you need to write code for the entire app based on the tasks that\
    \ the tech lead gives you. So that you understand better what you're working on, you're given other specs for \"ABM\"\
    \ as well.\n\nHere is a high level description of \"ABM\":\n```\nDevelopment of a Basic Agent-Based Model (ABM) named\
    \ \"ABM\" will be undertaken to simulate the South African cannabis and hemp industry using Streamlit. This basic version\
    \ will feature two types of agents: Farmers (formal and informal) with attributes like production capacity and compliance\
    \ status, and Regulators who affect market conditions and policies. The interactions will allow Farmers to respond to\
    \ market conditions and Regulators to implement policies.\n\nThe simulation will run over a timeframe of two years per\
    \ execution and is designed for a single user without support for multiple simultaneous users. The Streamlit interface\
    \ will enable user input for parameters such as market demand and regulatory conditions through sliders or input fields.\
    \ Users can control the simulation with start, stop, and reset buttons.\n\nData visualization will present results through\
    \ graphs or tables, showcasing key outputs like total production and compliance levels. However, no feedback mechanism\
    \ for user input is required for this application.\n\nDevelopment guidelines include maintaining a clean, well-documented\
    \ codebase, ensuring user-friendliness, and prioritizing quick loading and smooth interaction. Codebase documentation\
    \ will consist of an overview, in-code comments, descriptive docstrings, a comprehensive README file, API documentation\
    \ (if applicable), a change log or version control messages, testing documentation, deployment instructions, coding standards,\
    \ and future development notes.\n\nThe implementation does not require the collection of historical data input from users\
    \ since default values for the simulation parameters will be provided, which users can adjust. Design should account for\
    \ scalability for eventual enhancement with more complex features.\n```\n\n\nHere are user stories that specify how users\
    \ use \"ABM\":\n```\n\n- User will input parameters for market demand and regulatory conditions using sliders or input\
    \ fields in the Streamlit interface.\n\n- User will start the simulation by clicking the 'start' button in the Streamlit\
    \ interface.\n\n- User will stop the ongoing simulation by clicking the 'stop' button in the Streamlit interface.\n\n\
    - User will reset the simulation to initial conditions by clicking the 'reset' button in the Streamlit interface.\n\n\
    - User will observe the total production output through graphs or tables within the Streamlit interface.\n\n- User will\
    \ assess compliance levels of the Farmers through visualizations in the Streamlit interface.\n\n```\n\n\nHere are the\

    # ABM: Agent-Based Model\n\n## Overview\nABM is a simplified simulation tool designed to model the South African cannabis\
    \ and hemp industry dynamics using an agent-based approach in Streamlit. The model features two agent types: Farmers (both\
    \ formal and informal) with attributes like production capacity and compliance status, and Regulators, influencing the\
    \ market by policies. This simulation aims to help understand how these entities interact over a fixed period.\n\n## User\
    \ Guide\nUsers interact with the ABM simulation through a Streamlit interface to:\n* Input market demand and regulatory\
    \ conditions.\n* Control the simulation with start, stop, and reset functionalities.\n* Observe the outcomes through visualizations\
    \ of production and compliance levels.\n\n- Regulatory Conditions: Choose between 'Lenient', 'Strict', or 'Custom' to\
    \ determine the stringency of regulations in the simulation. 'Custom' allows setting a specific compliance factor that\
    \ affects farmer production.\n\n## Installation & Running the Simulation\n1. Clone the repository.\n2. Install the required\
    \ libraries: Streamlit, Python, Pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and altair.\n3. Run the `streamlit run streamlit_app.py` command\
    \ in your terminal to initiate the interface.\n\n## Features\n* Interactive Streamlit UI for input parameter configuration.\n\
    * Start, stop, and reset controls for the simulation.\n* Graphical representations for viewing simulation outputs.\n\n\
    ## Development and Contribution\nThe codebase adheres to clean-coding principles and is well-documented to facilitate\
    \ contributions. Developers should refer to in-code comments and docstrings for guidance. Contributions towards expanding\
    \ the ABM's features and scalability are welcome.\n\nFor developers, please ensure you:\n* Maintain the coding standards\
    \ as per the documentation.\n* Update the README.md and CHANGELOG.md as appropriate for new features or bug fixes.\n*\
    \ Add unit tests for new code to ensure reliability.\n\n## Technical Architecture\nABM runs a Streamlit application (`streamlit_app.py`)\
    \ that includes user input collection, control buttons, and output placeholders separated into modular Python files. The\
    \ simulation logic is encapsulated in `simulation_engine.py`, iterating over the various agent classes such as `farmer.py`\
    \ and `regulator.py`.\n\n## Project Structure\nThe project comprises several modules:\n* `/streamlit_app.py`: The entry\
    \ point for the Streamlit application.\n* `/interface`: Modules for the user input, control buttons, and outputs display.\n\
    * `/simulation`: Core modules for the agent-based model, including agent definitions and the simulation engine.\n\n##\
    \ License\nThis project is released under the XYZ License. For more details, see the `LICENSE` file included in the repository.\n\
    \n## Contact\nFor questions, suggestions, or contributions, please open an issue in the repository, and a maintainer will\
    \ get back to you.\n\n### Disclaimer\nThis simulation is a basic model and may not account for all real-world dynamics\
    \ of the South African cannabis and hemp industry. It is intended for educational and research purposes only.\n\n```\n\

    \ of this app down to these tasks:\n```\n1. Set up a basic Streamlit app with a simple interface that has placeholder\
    \ elements for user inputs (sliders and input fields), control buttons (start, stop, reset), and placeholders for visualizing\
    \ outputs (graphs and tables).\n\n2. Develop the ABM simulation engine in Python using classes to define Farmers and Regulators\
    \ with their attributes and methods for their behaviors and interactions.\n\n3. Integrate the ABM simulation engine with\
    \ the Streamlit app, connecting user inputs to the simulation parameters and enabling the control buttons to start, stop,\
    \ and reset the simulation.\n\n4. Implement data visualization for total production output and compliance levels using\
    \ matplotlib and altair for graphs, and pandas for data manipulation.\n\n5. Conduct a stream of beta tests of the entire\
    \ Streamlit app through iterative development cycles to ensure all parts work together smoothly, iron out any bugs and\
    \ enhance the user interface based on feedback.\n\n```\n\nYou are currently working on task #5 with the following description:\n\
    ```\nConduct a stream of beta tests of the entire Streamlit app through iterative development cycles to ensure all parts\
    \ work together smoothly, iron out any bugs and enhance the user interface based on feedback.\n```\nAll previous tasks\
    \ are finished and you don't have to work on them.\nAfter all the code is finished, a human developer will check if the\
    \ app works this way - `The app functions without bugs, responds swiftly to user inputs, and provides a user-friendly\
    \ experience with clear, comprehensible visualizations.`\n\nNow, tell me all the code that needs to be written to implement\
    \ ONLY this task and have it fully working and all commands that need to be run to implement this task.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\n\
    When you think about in which file should the new code go to, always try to make files as small as possible and put code\
    \ in more smaller files rather than in one big file. Whenever a file becomes too large (more than 50 lines of code) split\
    \ it into smaller files.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nRemember, I created an empty folder where I will start writing files that you\
    \ tell me and that are needed for this app.\nYou do not need to make any automated tests work.\n\nDO NOT specify commands\
    \ to create any folders or files, they will be created automatically - just specify the relative path to each file that\
    \ needs to be written.\n\nNever use the port 5000 to run the app, it's reserved."

    \ the beta testing phase.\n\n    **/CHANGELOG.md**\n    ```\n    # Changelog\n\n    ## [Unreleased]\n\n    ### Added\n\

    \ to replicate and verify the reported bugs, update existing code to fix issues, improve overall application performance,\
    \ and possibly refine the UI/UX based on tester feedback. Each cycle of fix and re-test would be iterated until the app\
    \ meets the quality standards.\n\n No new files are needed to be written to implement task number 5 as it focuses on testing\
    \ and refining existing implementations. However, two new markdown files have been suggested to keep track of the issues\
    \ and feedback (`issues_report.md` and `feedback.md`)."

    ```\nDetailed Prompt for Enhancing ABM Complexity\nProject Enhancement: Introducing Advanced Features to ABM\nTo: ABM\
    \ Development Team\n\nSubject: Enhancing Our ABM with Additional Complexity and Features\n\nCurrent State of the Model\n\
    \nOur existing ABM simulates the South African cannabis and hemp industry with two primary agent types (Farmers and Regulators)\
    \ and provides basic interaction through a Streamlit interface. Users can input market demand and regulatory conditions,\
    \ and observe outcomes through simple visualizations.\nProposed Enhancements\n\nIntroduction of New Agent Types:\n\nConsumers/Market\
    \ Agents: Reflect the demand side of the market. Attributes can include consumption patterns, price sensitivity, and preference\
    \ for formal or informal products.\nInvestors/Financial Institutions: Simulate investment dynamics in the industry. Attributes\
    \ might cover investment amounts, risk profiles, and return expectations.\nExpanded Metrics:\n\nBeyond production and\
    \ compliance, introduce metrics like market prices, investment returns, consumer satisfaction, and environmental impact.\n\
    Implement a dynamic system where these metrics influence and are influenced by agent actions and market conditions.\n\
    Advanced Visualizations:\n\nEnhance current visualizations to display complex interactions and trends over time. Consider\
    \ using advanced charting libraries like Plotly for interactive and detailed graphs.\nIntroduce dashboard-style presentations\
    \ showing multiple aspects of the simulation simultaneously, like market dynamics, regulatory impacts, and investment\
    \ trends.\nInteractive Scenario Building:\n\nAllow users to create and save different market scenarios. For example, what\
    \ if analyses for varying levels of investment, different regulatory environments, or shifts in consumer behavior.\nImplement\
    \ functionality for users to compare outcomes across different scenarios.\nReal-Time Data Integration (Optional):\n\n\
    If feasible, explore integrating real-time market data to enhance the simulation's realism. This could include current\
    \ market prices, investment trends, or regulatory updates.\nDevelopment Considerations\n\nEnsure that the introduction\
    \ of new agents and metrics does not compromise the model's performance. Optimize the simulation engine for handling increased\
    \ complexity.\nMaintain the clean-coding principles and documentation standards we have set. This is crucial for future\
    \ scalability and maintainability.\nTesting and validation become even more critical with these enhancements. Set up a\
    \ rigorous testing framework to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the updated model.\nConclusion\n\nThese enhancements\
    \ aim to elevate our ABM to a more comprehensive and insightful tool, offering deeper understanding and analysis of the\
    \ South African cannabis and hemp industry.\nWe look forward to these exciting developments and are available for any\
    \ discussions or clarifications needed as you proceed.\n```\n\nThe project directory tree looks like:\n\n/\n  /interface:\
    \ control_buttons.py, output_placeholders.py, output_visualization.py, user_input.py\n  /simulation: agent.py, data_collector.py,\
    \ farmer.py, regulator.py, simulation_engine.py, simulation_state.py\n  /tests\n  /visualization: compliance_levels.py,\
    \ production_output.py\n  README.md, streamlit_app.py\n\n\nI want you to create a list of steps that are needed to debug\
    \ this issue.\n\nA step can be either a `command` or `code_change`.\n\n`command` step will run a command on the machine\
    \ and will return the CLI output to you so you can see what to do next. Note that the command will be run on a Windows\
    \ machine.\n\n`code_change` step will change the code and you need to thoroughly describe what needs to be implemented.\
    \ I will implement the requested changes and let you know.\n\nAlso, make sure that at least the last step has `check_if_fixed`\
    \ set to TRUE.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nWhen you think about in which file should the new code go to, always try to make files\
    \ as small as possible and put code in more smaller files rather than in one big file. Whenever a file becomes too large\
    \ (more than 50 lines of code) split it into smaller files.\n\n"
