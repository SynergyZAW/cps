  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: "Here is how the file `simulation/farmer.py` looks like right now:\n```\nfrom .agent import Agent\n\nclass Farmer(Agent):\n\
    \    def __init__(self, name, production_capacity, compliance):\n        super().__init__(name)\n        self.production_capacity\
    \ = production_capacity\n        self.compliance = compliance\n        self.production = 0\n\n    def produce(self, amount):\n\
    \        self.production = amount\n\n    def step(self):\n        pass\n```\n\nAnd here is the new implementation for\
    \ the same file:\n```\nfrom .agent import Agent\n\nclass Farmer(Agent):\n    def __init__(self, name, production_capacity,\
    \ compliance):\n        super().__init__(name)\n        self.production_capacity = production_capacity\n        self.compliance\
    \ = compliance\n        self.production = 0\n\n    def produce(self, amount):\n        self.production = amount\n\n  \
    \  def earn(self, revenue):\n        # [OLD CODE] Implement earning functionality\n\n    def step(self, market_conditions,\
    \ regulatory_conditions):\n        if self.compliance:\n            adjusted_production_capacity = self.production_capacity\
    \ * regulatory_conditions.get('compliance_factor', 1)\n        else:\n            adjusted_production_capacity = self.production_capacity\n\
    \        demand = market_conditions.get('demand', 0)\n        price = market_conditions.get('price', 0)\n        production\
    \ = min(adjusted_production_capacity, demand)\n        self.produce(production)\n        self.earn(production * price)\n\
    \        # Implement changes in compliance based on regulatory conditions\n        # INPUT_REQUIRED {Add follow-up actions\
    \ for Farmer based on regulatory conditions}\n\n```\n\nNow, implement the new changes into the previously implemented\
    \ file and return the entirely coded file. Do not add any lines of code that are not in the previously coded file or the\
    \ new implementation but only combine those two.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nAll lines of code in the new implementation should\
    \ be present. From the old implementation, only take the ones that are replaced with the comment `[OLD CODE]` in the new\
    \ implementation\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nMake sure that you respond with all lines of code that are replaced by these comments,\
    \ including all control structures, error handling, and any other relevant logic that was in the original code.\nUnder\
    \ no circumstances should you ever leave any part of the code snippet unwritten. Every single line of code that exists\
    \ in the place where the comment lives right now should be replaced. Do not include any code that is above or below the\
    \ comment but only the code that should be in the position of the comment."
