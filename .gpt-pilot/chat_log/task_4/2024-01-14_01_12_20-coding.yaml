  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: "Here is how the file `interface/output_visualization.py` looks like right now:\n```\nimport streamlit as st\n\
    from visualization.production_output import show_total_production\nfrom visualization.compliance_levels import show_compliance_levels\n\
    \ndef display_visualizations(simulation_data):\n    st.subheader(\"Total Production Output\")\n    total_production_chart\
    \ = show_total_production(simulation_data)\n    st.pyplot(total_production_chart)\n\n    st.subheader(\"Compliance Levels\"\
    )\n    compliance_levels_chart = show_compliance_levels(simulation_data)\n    st.altair_chart(compliance_levels_chart,\
    \ use_container_width=True)\n\n```\n\nAnd here is the new implementation for the same file:\n```\nimport streamlit as\
    \ st\nimport matplotlib\nmatplotlib.use('Agg')\nfrom visualization.production_output import show_total_production\nfrom\
    \ visualization.compliance_levels import show_compliance_levels\n\ndef display_visualizations(simulation_data):\n    st.subheader(\"\
    Total Production Output\")\n    total_production_chart = show_total_production(simulation_data)\n    st.pyplot(total_production_chart)\n\
    \n    st.subheader(\"Compliance Levels\")\n    compliance_levels_chart = show_compliance_levels(simulation_data)\n   \
    \ st.altair_chart(compliance_levels_chart, use_container_width=True)\n\n[OLD CODE] Make sure all other previously implemented\
    \ functionalities remain intact.\n\n```\n\nNow, implement the new changes into the previously implemented file and return\
    \ the entirely coded file. Do not add any lines of code that are not in the previously coded file or the new implementation\
    \ but only combine those two.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nAll lines of code in the new implementation should be present. From the\
    \ old implementation, only take the ones that are replaced with the comment `[OLD CODE]` in the new implementation\n\n\
    **IMPORTANT**\nMake sure that you respond with all lines of code that are replaced by these comments, including all control\
    \ structures, error handling, and any other relevant logic that was in the original code.\nUnder no circumstances should\
    \ you ever leave any part of the code snippet unwritten. Every single line of code that exists in the place where the\
    \ comment lives right now should be replaced. Do not include any code that is above or below the comment but only the\
    \ code that should be in the position of the comment."
