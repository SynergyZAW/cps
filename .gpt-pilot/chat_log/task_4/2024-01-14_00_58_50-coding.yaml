  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: "You are working on a App called \"ABM\" and you need to write code for the entire app based on the tasks that\
    \ the tech lead gives you. So that you understand better what you're working on, you're given other specs for \"ABM\"\
    \ as well.\n\nHere is a high level description of \"ABM\":\n```\nDevelopment of a Basic Agent-Based Model (ABM) named\
    \ \"ABM\" will be undertaken to simulate the South African cannabis and hemp industry using Streamlit. This basic version\
    \ will feature two types of agents: Farmers (formal and informal) with attributes like production capacity and compliance\
    \ status, and Regulators who affect market conditions and policies. The interactions will allow Farmers to respond to\
    \ market conditions and Regulators to implement policies.\n\nThe simulation will run over a timeframe of two years per\
    \ execution and is designed for a single user without support for multiple simultaneous users. The Streamlit interface\
    \ will enable user input for parameters such as market demand and regulatory conditions through sliders or input fields.\
    \ Users can control the simulation with start, stop, and reset buttons.\n\nData visualization will present results through\
    \ graphs or tables, showcasing key outputs like total production and compliance levels. However, no feedback mechanism\
    \ for user input is required for this application.\n\nDevelopment guidelines include maintaining a clean, well-documented\
    \ codebase, ensuring user-friendliness, and prioritizing quick loading and smooth interaction. Codebase documentation\
    \ will consist of an overview, in-code comments, descriptive docstrings, a comprehensive README file, API documentation\
    \ (if applicable), a change log or version control messages, testing documentation, deployment instructions, coding standards,\
    \ and future development notes.\n\nThe implementation does not require the collection of historical data input from users\
    \ since default values for the simulation parameters will be provided, which users can adjust. Design should account for\
    \ scalability for eventual enhancement with more complex features.\n```\n\n\nHere are user stories that specify how users\
    \ use \"ABM\":\n```\n\n- User will input parameters for market demand and regulatory conditions using sliders or input\
    \ fields in the Streamlit interface.\n\n- User will start the simulation by clicking the 'start' button in the Streamlit\
    \ interface.\n\n- User will stop the ongoing simulation by clicking the 'stop' button in the Streamlit interface.\n\n\
    - User will reset the simulation to initial conditions by clicking the 'reset' button in the Streamlit interface.\n\n\
    - User will observe the total production output through graphs or tables within the Streamlit interface.\n\n- User will\
    \ assess compliance levels of the Farmers through visualizations in the Streamlit interface.\n\n```\n\n\nHere are the\
    \ technologies that you need to use for this project:\n```\n\n- Streamlit\n\n- Python\n\n- Pandas\n\n- numpy\n\n- matplotlib\n\

    \ for user inputs (sliders and input fields), control buttons (start, stop, reset), and placeholders for visualizing outputs\
    \ (graphs and tables).\n\n2. Develop the ABM simulation engine in Python using classes to define Farmers and Regulators\
    \ with their attributes and methods for their behaviors and interactions.\n\n3. Integrate the ABM simulation engine with\
    \ the Streamlit app, connecting user inputs to the simulation parameters and enabling the control buttons to start, stop,\
    \ and reset the simulation.\n\n4. Implement data visualization for total production output and compliance levels using\
    \ matplotlib and altair for graphs, and pandas for data manipulation.\n\n5. Conduct a stream of beta tests of the entire\
    \ Streamlit app through iterative development cycles to ensure all parts work together smoothly, iron out any bugs and\
    \ enhance the user interface based on feedback.\n\n```\n\nYou are currently working on task #4 with the following description:\n\
    ```\nImplement data visualization for total production output and compliance levels using matplotlib and altair for graphs,\
    \ and pandas for data manipulation.\n```\nAll previous tasks are finished and you don't have to work on them.\nAfter all\
    \ the code is finished, a human developer will check if the app works this way - `User views accurate and responsive graphs\
    \ and tables reflecting total production and compliance levels corresponding to the simulation's outputs.`\n\nNow, tell\
    \ me all the code that needs to be written to implement ONLY this task and have it fully working and all commands that\
    \ need to be run to implement this task.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nWhen you think about in which file should the new code go to,\
    \ always try to make files as small as possible and put code in more smaller files rather than in one big file. Whenever\
    \ a file becomes too large (more than 50 lines of code) split it into smaller files.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nRemember, I created\
    \ an empty folder where I will start writing files that you tell me and that are needed for this app.\nYou do not need\
    \ to make any automated tests work.\n\nDO NOT specify commands to create any folders or files, they will be created automatically\
    \ - just specify the relative path to each file that needs to be written.\n\nNever use the port 5000 to run the app, it's\

  content: "To implement data visualization for total production output and compliance levels, we will first need to modify\
    \ the existing simulation engine and associated classes to collect the data necessary for these visualizations. Then,\
