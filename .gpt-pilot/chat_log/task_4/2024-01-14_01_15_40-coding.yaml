  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: "You are working on a App called \"ABM\" and you need to write code for the entire application.\n\nHere is a high\
    \ level description of \"ABM\":\n```\nDevelopment of a Basic Agent-Based Model (ABM) named \"ABM\" will be undertaken\
    \ to simulate the South African cannabis and hemp industry using Streamlit. This basic version will feature two types\
    \ of agents: Farmers (formal and informal) with attributes like production capacity and compliance status, and Regulators\
    \ who affect market conditions and policies. The interactions will allow Farmers to respond to market conditions and Regulators\
    \ to implement policies.\n\nThe simulation will run over a timeframe of two years per execution and is designed for a\
    \ single user without support for multiple simultaneous users. The Streamlit interface will enable user input for parameters\
    \ such as market demand and regulatory conditions through sliders or input fields. Users can control the simulation with\
    \ start, stop, and reset buttons.\n\nData visualization will present results through graphs or tables, showcasing key\
    \ outputs like total production and compliance levels. However, no feedback mechanism for user input is required for this\
    \ application.\n\nDevelopment guidelines include maintaining a clean, well-documented codebase, ensuring user-friendliness,\
    \ and prioritizing quick loading and smooth interaction. Codebase documentation will consist of an overview, in-code comments,\
    \ descriptive docstrings, a comprehensive README file, API documentation (if applicable), a change log or version control\
    \ messages, testing documentation, deployment instructions, coding standards, and future development notes.\n\nThe implementation\
    \ does not require the collection of historical data input from users since default values for the simulation parameters\
    \ will be provided, which users can adjust. Design should account for scalability for eventual enhancement with more complex\
    \ features.\n```\n\nHere are the technologies that you need to use for this project:\n```\n- Streamlit\n- Python\n- Pandas\n\
    - numpy\n- matplotlib\n- altair\n- Git\n```\n\n\nDevelopment process of this app was split into smaller tasks. Here is\
    \ the list of all tasks:\n```\n1. Set up a basic Streamlit app with a simple interface that has placeholder elements for\
    \ user inputs (sliders and input fields), control buttons (start, stop, reset), and placeholders for visualizing outputs\
    \ (graphs and tables).\n\n2. Develop the ABM simulation engine in Python using classes to define Farmers and Regulators\
    \ with their attributes and methods for their behaviors and interactions.\n\n3. Integrate the ABM simulation engine with\
    \ the Streamlit app, connecting user inputs to the simulation parameters and enabling the control buttons to start, stop,\
    \ and reset the simulation.\n\n4. Implement data visualization for total production output and compliance levels using\
    \ matplotlib and altair for graphs, and pandas for data manipulation.\n\n5. Conduct a stream of beta tests of the entire\
    \ Streamlit app through iterative development cycles to ensure all parts work together smoothly, iron out any bugs and\
    \ enhance the user interface based on feedback.\n\n```\nYou are currently working on task \"Implement data visualization\
    \ for total production output and compliance levels using matplotlib and altair for graphs, and pandas for data manipulation.\"\
    \ and you have to focus only on that task.\n\n\nA part of the app is already finished.Here are files that are currently\

    # ABM: Agent-Based Model\n\n## Overview\nABM is a simplified simulation tool designed to model the South African cannabis\
    \ and hemp industry dynamics using an agent-based approach in Streamlit. The model features two agent types: Farmers (both\
    \ formal and informal) with attributes like production capacity and compliance status, and Regulators, influencing the\
    \ market by policies. This simulation aims to help understand how these entities interact over a fixed period.\n\n## User\
    \ Guide\nUsers interact with the ABM simulation through a Streamlit interface to:\n* Input market demand and regulatory\
    \ conditions.\n* Control the simulation with start, stop, and reset functionalities.\n* Observe the outcomes through visualizations\
    \ of production and compliance levels.\n\n## Installation & Running the Simulation\n1. Clone the repository.\n2. Install\
    \ the required libraries: Streamlit, Python, Pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and altair.\n3. Run the `streamlit run streamlit_app.py`\
    \ command in your terminal to initiate the interface.\n\n## Features\n* Interactive Streamlit UI for input parameter configuration.\n\
    * Start, stop, and reset controls for the simulation.\n* Graphical representations for viewing simulation outputs.\n\n\
    ## Development and Contribution\nThe codebase adheres to clean-coding principles and is well-documented to facilitate\
    \ contributions. Developers should refer to in-code comments and docstrings for guidance. Contributions towards expanding\
    \ the ABM's features and scalability are welcome.\n\nFor developers, please ensure you:\n* Maintain the coding standards\
    \ as per the documentation.\n* Update the README.md and CHANGELOG.md as appropriate for new features or bug fixes.\n*\
    \ Add unit tests for new code to ensure reliability.\n\n## Technical Architecture\nABM runs a Streamlit application (`streamlit_app.py`)\
    \ that includes user input collection, control buttons, and output placeholders separated into modular Python files. The\
    \ simulation logic is encapsulated in `simulation_engine.py`, iterating over the various agent classes such as `farmer.py`\
    \ and `regulator.py`.\n\n## Project Structure\nThe project comprises several modules:\n* `/streamlit_app.py`: The entry\
    \ point for the Streamlit application.\n* `/interface`: Modules for the user input, control buttons, and outputs display.\n\
    * `/simulation`: Core modules for the agent-based model, including agent definitions and the simulation engine.\n\n##\

    ```\n\nCan you debug this issue or implement changes to comply with the additional user input?\n\nTell me all the new\
    \ code that needs to be written or modified to implement current task and have it fully working. You can count that the\
    \ environment is set up previously and packages listed in files are installed so tell me only commands needed for installation\
    \ of new dependencies, if there are any.\n\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nWhen you think about in which file should the new code go\
    \ to, always try to make files as small as possible and put code in more smaller files rather than in one big file. Whenever\
    \ a file becomes too large (more than 50 lines of code) split it into smaller files.\n\n\nYou do not need to make any\
    \ automated tests work.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nDo not tell me anything about setting up the database or anything OS related\
    \ - only if some dependencies need to be installed."

  content: "Given the feedback from the tester that \"the simulation does not run when the button is pressed,\" let's first\
    \ consider the potential sources of this issue:\n\n1. The buttons might not actually be initiating the actions they're\
    \ supposed to because the logic might not be correctly wired up to the buttons.\n2. There might be an issue in the simulation\
    \ engine, or the state management might not be properly configured.\n3. There could be a logical error in the transition\
    \ from state to state.\n\nLet's go through the code to detect potential issues concerning these aspects.\n\nFirst, we\
    \ notice that in the `control_buttons.py`, a new `SimulationEngine` instance is being created inside the 'Start' button\
    \ event handler every time the button is pressed but not being used to run the simulation since the `run` method call\
    \ is not there.\n\n**/interface/control_buttons.py**\n```python\nfrom simulation.simulation_state import simulation_state\n\
    import streamlit as st\n\n# We'll import the simulation engine so we can start and reset the simulation appropriately\n\
    from simulation.simulation_engine import SimulationEngine\n\n\ndef show():\n    st.header(\"Simulation Control\")\n  \
    \  sim_engine = SimulationEngine()  # Create a SimulationEngine instance at the top\n    \n    if st.button('Start'):\n\
    \        # Update the simulation state to reflect that the simulation should be running\n        simulation_state.start()\n\
    \        # Start the simulation\n        sim_engine.run()  # Call run on the sim_engine instance\n\n    if st.button('Stop'):\n\
    \        # Update the simulation state to reflect that the simulation should be stopped\n        simulation_state.stop()\n\
    \n    if st.button('Reset'):\n        # Reset the simulation to initial conditions\n        simulation_state.reset()\n\
    \        sim_engine.reset()  # Reset the sim_engine instance\n```\n\nWe moved the instantiation of `SimulationEngine`\
    \ to the top of the `show` function in `control_buttons.py` so it's the same instance being acted upon in each control\
    \ button case. `sim_engine.run()` is now called within the 'Start' button handler to start the simulation, while `sim_engine.reset()`\
    \ is called within the 'Reset' button handler to reset the simulation.\n\nNext, it is important to check the `SimulationEngine.run()`\
    \ method. It seems like you have a placeholder `# INPUT_REQUIRED` which suggests there might be some logic missing or\
    \ pending completion. If that's not the case, and the actual simulation logic is implemented inside `self.step()`, make\
    \ sure that the simulation state on stop or reset is handled correctly \u2013 it should not only modify the `active` flag\
    \ but also cleanup and setup for next run if necessary.\n\nEnsure to return immediately from `step()` if `simulation_state.active`\
    \ is `False` to not resume the simulation once the stop button is clicked.\n\n**/simulation/simulation_engine.py**\n```python\n\
    \    # ... other methods ...\n\n    def run(self, steps=24):\n        self.reset()\n        simulation_state.start()\n\
    \        for _ in range(steps):\n            if not simulation_state.active:\n                break  # Stop the simulation\
    \ if the active flag is False\n            self.set_market_conditions()\n            self.step()\n        simulation_state.stop()\n\
    \n    # ... other methods ...\n```\n\nEnsure the `SimulationState` object is handling the states correctly and that there's\
    \ no mismatch in the state transitions.\n\nThere is no need to add any new packages or dependencies since the specified\
    \ packages already cover the data visualization requirements, and the issue seems to be more in the logic and state management\
    \ rather than missing features.\n\nWith these modifications, the initial issue stated by the tester should be resolved.\
    \ The simulation should now start running when the start button is pressed, stop when the stop button is pressed, and\
    \ reset when the reset button is pressed, providing the expected visualizations in the Streamlit interface."
