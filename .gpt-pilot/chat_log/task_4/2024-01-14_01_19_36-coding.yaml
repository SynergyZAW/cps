  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: "You are working on a App called \"ABM\" and you need to write code for the entire application.\n\nHere is a high\
    \ level description of \"ABM\":\n```\nDevelopment of a Basic Agent-Based Model (ABM) named \"ABM\" will be undertaken\
    \ to simulate the South African cannabis and hemp industry using Streamlit. This basic version will feature two types\
    \ of agents: Farmers (formal and informal) with attributes like production capacity and compliance status, and Regulators\
    \ who affect market conditions and policies. The interactions will allow Farmers to respond to market conditions and Regulators\
    \ to implement policies.\n\nThe simulation will run over a timeframe of two years per execution and is designed for a\
    \ single user without support for multiple simultaneous users. The Streamlit interface will enable user input for parameters\
    \ such as market demand and regulatory conditions through sliders or input fields. Users can control the simulation with\
    \ start, stop, and reset buttons.\n\nData visualization will present results through graphs or tables, showcasing key\
    \ outputs like total production and compliance levels. However, no feedback mechanism for user input is required for this\
    \ application.\n\nDevelopment guidelines include maintaining a clean, well-documented codebase, ensuring user-friendliness,\
    \ and prioritizing quick loading and smooth interaction. Codebase documentation will consist of an overview, in-code comments,\
    \ descriptive docstrings, a comprehensive README file, API documentation (if applicable), a change log or version control\
    \ messages, testing documentation, deployment instructions, coding standards, and future development notes.\n\nThe implementation\
    \ does not require the collection of historical data input from users since default values for the simulation parameters\
    \ will be provided, which users can adjust. Design should account for scalability for eventual enhancement with more complex\
    \ features.\n```\n\nHere are the technologies that you need to use for this project:\n```\n- Streamlit\n- Python\n- Pandas\n\
    - numpy\n- matplotlib\n- altair\n- Git\n```\n\n\nDevelopment process of this app was split into smaller tasks. Here is\
    \ the list of all tasks:\n```\n1. Set up a basic Streamlit app with a simple interface that has placeholder elements for\
    \ user inputs (sliders and input fields), control buttons (start, stop, reset), and placeholders for visualizing outputs\
    \ (graphs and tables).\n\n2. Develop the ABM simulation engine in Python using classes to define Farmers and Regulators\
    \ with their attributes and methods for their behaviors and interactions.\n\n3. Integrate the ABM simulation engine with\
    \ the Streamlit app, connecting user inputs to the simulation parameters and enabling the control buttons to start, stop,\
    \ and reset the simulation.\n\n4. Implement data visualization for total production output and compliance levels using\
    \ matplotlib and altair for graphs, and pandas for data manipulation.\n\n5. Conduct a stream of beta tests of the entire\
    \ Streamlit app through iterative development cycles to ensure all parts work together smoothly, iron out any bugs and\
    \ enhance the user interface based on feedback.\n\n```\nYou are currently working on task \"Implement data visualization\
    \ for total production output and compliance levels using matplotlib and altair for graphs, and pandas for data manipulation.\"\
    \ and you have to focus only on that task.\n\n\nA part of the app is already finished.Here are files that are currently\

    \ model the South African cannabis and hemp industry dynamics using an agent-based approach in Streamlit. The model features\
    \ two agent types: Farmers (both formal and informal) with attributes like production capacity and compliance status,\
    \ and Regulators, influencing the market by policies. This simulation aims to help understand how these entities interact\
    \ over a fixed period.\n\n## User Guide\nUsers interact with the ABM simulation through a Streamlit interface to:\n* Input\
    \ market demand and regulatory conditions.\n* Control the simulation with start, stop, and reset functionalities.\n* Observe\
    \ the outcomes through visualizations of production and compliance levels.\n\n## Installation & Running the Simulation\n\
    1. Clone the repository.\n2. Install the required libraries: Streamlit, Python, Pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and altair.\n\
    3. Run the `streamlit run streamlit_app.py` command in your terminal to initiate the interface.\n\n## Features\n* Interactive\
    \ Streamlit UI for input parameter configuration.\n* Start, stop, and reset controls for the simulation.\n* Graphical\
    \ representations for viewing simulation outputs.\n\n## Development and Contribution\nThe codebase adheres to clean-coding\
    \ principles and is well-documented to facilitate contributions. Developers should refer to in-code comments and docstrings\
    \ for guidance. Contributions towards expanding the ABM's features and scalability are welcome.\n\nFor developers, please\
    \ ensure you:\n* Maintain the coding standards as per the documentation.\n* Update the README.md and CHANGELOG.md as appropriate\
    \ for new features or bug fixes.\n* Add unit tests for new code to ensure reliability.\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\
    ABM runs a Streamlit application (`streamlit_app.py`) that includes user input collection, control buttons, and output\
    \ placeholders separated into modular Python files. The simulation logic is encapsulated in `simulation_engine.py`, iterating\
    \ over the various agent classes such as `farmer.py` and `regulator.py`.\n\n## Project Structure\nThe project comprises\
    \ several modules:\n* `/streamlit_app.py`: The entry point for the Streamlit application.\n* `/interface`: Modules for\
    \ the user input, control buttons, and outputs display.\n* `/simulation`: Core modules for the agent-based model, including\
    \ agent definitions and the simulation engine.\n\n## License\nThis project is released under the XYZ License. For more\
    \ details, see the `LICENSE` file included in the repository.\n\n## Contact\nFor questions, suggestions, or contributions,\
    \ please open an issue in the repository, and a maintainer will get back to you.\n\n### Disclaimer\nThis simulation is\

  content: "To address the feedback provided, we need to clarify the purpose of the \"Regulatory Conditions\" input field\
    \ within the user interface and ensure that field inputs directly influence the simulation outcome in a way that is visible\
    \ to the user.\n\nThe steps to fulfill the task based on the current implementation are as follows:\n\n1. Clarify the\
    \ purpose of the regulatory conditions field in the user interface and process the input to affect the simulation.\n\n\
    **interface/user_input.py**\n```python\n# Modify the show function to explain the regulatory_conditions input and\n# create\
    \ a more structured way of accepting input values:\ndef show():\n    st.sidebar.header(\"User Inputs\")\n\n    user_inputs['market_demand']\
    \ = st.sidebar.slider('Market Demand', min_value=0, max_value=100, value=50)\n    # Changed the input field to accept\
    \ a selection of different regulatory conditions.\n    reg_conditions = st.sidebar.radio('Regulatory Conditions', ['Lenient',\
    \ 'Strict', 'Custom'])\n    user_inputs['regulatory_conditions'] = reg_conditions\n\n    # Optionally display a numeric\
    \ input when 'Custom' is selected:\n    if reg_conditions == 'Custom':\n        compliance_factor = st.sidebar.number_input('Custom\
    \ Compliance Factor', \n                                                    min_value=0.5, \n                        \

    \ user_inputs['custom_compliance_factor'] = compliance_factor\n```\n\n2. Process the regulatory conditions inputs within\
    \ the simulation engine to affect how Farmer and Regulator agents interpret market conditions and policies.\n\n**simulation/simulation_engine.py**\n\
    ```python\n    def get_regulatory_conditions(self):\n        # Map regulatory conditions to a compliance factor\n    \
    \    reg_conditions = user_inputs.get('regulatory_conditions', 'Lenient')\n        custom_compliance_factor = user_inputs.get('custom_compliance_factor',\
    \ 1)\n        compliance_factor = {\n            'Lenient': 1.2,\n            'Strict': 0.8,\n            'Custom': custom_compliance_factor\n\
    \        }.get(reg_conditions, 1)\n\n        regulatory_conditions = {\n            'compliance_factor': compliance_factor,\
    \  \n            'other_factors': {}  # Potentially expand based on the complexity of the simulation\n        }\n\n  \
    \      return regulatory_conditions\n```\n\n3. Remove unnecessary fields from the user input when they are not relevant.\
    \ For example, if the user selects predefined regulatory conditions (\"Lenient\" or \"Strict\"), there is no need to show\
    \ a custom input for the compliance factor. \n\n4. Update the documentation within the codebase to reflect changes that\
    \ have been made in the user interface and how the regulatory conditions are being utilized in the simulation engine.\n\
    \n**/README.md**\n```markdown\n## User Guide (Updated Section)\n- Regulatory Conditions: Choose between predesigned options\
    \ like 'Lenient' and 'Strict' or select 'Custom' to input a specific compliance factor. This setting influences the production\
    \ behavior of Farmers in the simulation.\n```\n\nBy making these changes, the \"ABM\" application should interpret user\
    \ input more effectively, and the user should understand the purpose and effect of the \"Regulatory Conditions\" field.\
    \ Remember, after making the changes, you need to test them in your local development environment to make sure everything\
    \ works as expected before considering the task complete."

  \ Agent-Based Model\\n\\n## Overview\\nABM is a simplified simulation tool designed to model the South African cannabis\
  \ and hemp industry dynamics using an agent-based approach in Streamlit. The model features two agent types: Farmers (both\
  \ formal and informal) with attributes like production capacity and compliance status, and Regulators, influencing the market\
  \ by policies. This simulation aims to help understand how these entities interact over a fixed period.\\n\\n## User Guide\\\
  nUsers interact with the ABM simulation through a Streamlit interface to:\\n* Input market demand and regulatory conditions.\\\
  n* Control the simulation with start, stop, and reset functionalities.\\n* Observe the outcomes through visualizations of\
  \ production and compliance levels.\\n\\n(Updated Section)\\n- Regulatory Conditions: Choose between 'Lenient', 'Strict',\
  \ or 'Custom' to determine the stringency of regulations in the simulation. 'Custom' allows setting a specific compliance\
  \ factor that affects farmer production.\\n\\n// [OLD CODE] Rest of README content\\n\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
