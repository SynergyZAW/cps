  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: "You are working on a App called \"ABM\" and you need to write code for the entire application.\n\nHere is a high\
    \ level description of \"ABM\":\n```\nDevelopment of a Basic Agent-Based Model (ABM) named \"ABM\" will be undertaken\
    \ to simulate the South African cannabis and hemp industry using Streamlit. This basic version will feature two types\
    \ of agents: Farmers (formal and informal) with attributes like production capacity and compliance status, and Regulators\
    \ who affect market conditions and policies. The interactions will allow Farmers to respond to market conditions and Regulators\
    \ to implement policies.\n\nThe simulation will run over a timeframe of two years per execution and is designed for a\
    \ single user without support for multiple simultaneous users. The Streamlit interface will enable user input for parameters\
    \ such as market demand and regulatory conditions through sliders or input fields. Users can control the simulation with\
    \ start, stop, and reset buttons.\n\nData visualization will present results through graphs or tables, showcasing key\
    \ outputs like total production and compliance levels. However, no feedback mechanism for user input is required for this\
    \ application.\n\nDevelopment guidelines include maintaining a clean, well-documented codebase, ensuring user-friendliness,\
    \ and prioritizing quick loading and smooth interaction. Codebase documentation will consist of an overview, in-code comments,\
    \ descriptive docstrings, a comprehensive README file, API documentation (if applicable), a change log or version control\
    \ messages, testing documentation, deployment instructions, coding standards, and future development notes.\n\nThe implementation\
    \ does not require the collection of historical data input from users since default values for the simulation parameters\
    \ will be provided, which users can adjust. Design should account for scalability for eventual enhancement with more complex\
    \ features.\n```\n\nHere are the technologies that you need to use for this project:\n```\n- Streamlit\n- Python\n- Pandas\n\
    - numpy\n- matplotlib\n- altair\n- Git\n```\n\n\nDevelopment process of this app was split into smaller tasks. Here is\
    \ the list of all tasks:\n```\n1. Set up a basic Streamlit app with a simple interface that has placeholder elements for\
    \ user inputs (sliders and input fields), control buttons (start, stop, reset), and placeholders for visualizing outputs\
    \ (graphs and tables).\n\n2. Develop the ABM simulation engine in Python using classes to define Farmers and Regulators\
    \ with their attributes and methods for their behaviors and interactions.\n\n3. Integrate the ABM simulation engine with\
    \ the Streamlit app, connecting user inputs to the simulation parameters and enabling the control buttons to start, stop,\
    \ and reset the simulation.\n\n4. Implement data visualization for total production output and compliance levels using\
    \ matplotlib and altair for graphs, and pandas for data manipulation.\n\n5. Conduct a stream of beta tests of the entire\
    \ Streamlit app through iterative development cycles to ensure all parts work together smoothly, iron out any bugs and\
    \ enhance the user interface based on feedback.\n\n```\nYou are currently working on task \"Implement data visualization\
    \ for total production output and compliance levels using matplotlib and altair for graphs, and pandas for data manipulation.\"\

    # ABM: Agent-Based Model\n\n## Overview\nABM is a simplified simulation tool designed to model the South African cannabis\
    \ and hemp industry dynamics using an agent-based approach in Streamlit. The model features two agent types: Farmers (both\
    \ formal and informal) with attributes like production capacity and compliance status, and Regulators, influencing the\
    \ market by policies. This simulation aims to help understand how these entities interact over a fixed period.\n\n## User\
    \ Guide\nUsers interact with the ABM simulation through a Streamlit interface to:\n* Input market demand and regulatory\
    \ conditions.\n* Control the simulation with start, stop, and reset functionalities.\n* Observe the outcomes through visualizations\
    \ of production and compliance levels.\n\n## Installation & Running the Simulation\n1. Clone the repository.\n2. Install\
    \ the required libraries: Streamlit, Python, Pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and altair.\n3. Run the `streamlit run streamlit_app.py`\
    \ command in your terminal to initiate the interface.\n\n## Features\n* Interactive Streamlit UI for input parameter configuration.\n\
    * Start, stop, and reset controls for the simulation.\n* Graphical representations for viewing simulation outputs.\n\n\
    ## Development and Contribution\nThe codebase adheres to clean-coding principles and is well-documented to facilitate\
    \ contributions. Developers should refer to in-code comments and docstrings for guidance. Contributions towards expanding\
    \ the ABM's features and scalability are welcome.\n\nFor developers, please ensure you:\n* Maintain the coding standards\
    \ as per the documentation.\n* Update the README.md and CHANGELOG.md as appropriate for new features or bug fixes.\n*\
    \ Add unit tests for new code to ensure reliability.\n\n## Technical Architecture\nABM runs a Streamlit application (`streamlit_app.py`)\
    \ that includes user input collection, control buttons, and output placeholders separated into modular Python files. The\
    \ simulation logic is encapsulated in `simulation_engine.py`, iterating over the various agent classes such as `farmer.py`\
    \ and `regulator.py`.\n\n## Project Structure\nThe project comprises several modules:\n* `/streamlit_app.py`: The entry\
    \ point for the Streamlit application.\n* `/interface`: Modules for the user input, control buttons, and outputs display.\n\
    * `/simulation`: Core modules for the agent-based model, including agent definitions and the simulation engine.\n\n##\

    \ the app \"ABM\" sent you some additional info. Here it is:\n```\nWe aim to improve the realism and functionality of\
    \ our Agent-Based Model (ABM) for the South African cannabis and hemp industry. This involves enhancing the actions and\
    \ behaviors of different agent types within our model.\nOverview of Requirements\n\nFarmer Agents:\n\nCurrently, our farmer\
    \ agents have basic attributes like production capacity and compliance status. However, their actions within each simulation\
    \ step are not fully defined.\nWe need to ensure that each farmer agent can adjust their production based on external\
    \ factors such as market demand and regulatory changes.\nThe farmer's production should also reflect whether they are\
    \ complying with regulations.\nRegulator Agents:\n\nRegulator agents are meant to simulate the impact of policy decisions\
    \ on the market.\nThey should be able to modify market conditions, like changing the demand or implementing penalties\
    \ for non-compliance.\nTheir actions should dynamically influence the market and other agents within the simulation.\n\
    Investor/Stakeholder Agents:\n\nThese agents should be able to react to the current market conditions.\nTheir actions\
    \ might include making investment decisions or providing feedback based on the performance of the market.\nImplementation\
    \ Goals\n\nEach agent type should have a distinct set of actions that they perform in each step of the simulation, reflecting\
    \ their role in the industry.\nThe interactions between different agents should realistically mimic the dynamics of the\
    \ cannabis and hemp market.\nTesting and Validation\n\nAfter implementing these enhancements, we need to test the model\
    \ thoroughly to ensure that the agent behaviors are realistic and align with our expectations.\nThe results of the simulation\
    \ should provide us with meaningful insights into the industry dynamics.\n```\n\nCan you debug this issue or implement\
    \ changes to comply with the additional user input?\n\nTell me all the new code that needs to be written or modified to\
    \ implement current task and have it fully working. You can count that the environment is set up previously and packages\
    \ listed in files are installed so tell me only commands needed for installation of new dependencies, if there are any.\n\
    \n\n**IMPORTANT**\nWhen you think about in which file should the new code go to, always try to make files as small as\
    \ possible and put code in more smaller files rather than in one big file. Whenever a file becomes too large (more than\
    \ 50 lines of code) split it into smaller files.\n\n\nYou do not need to make any automated tests work.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\n\
    Do not tell me anything about setting up the database or anything OS related - only if some dependencies need to be installed."

  content: "Based on the new information provided by your colleague and considering the existing codebase, it seems enhancements\
    \ are required in the simulation engine to better define the behavior of Farmer and Regulator agents. No new dependencies\
    \ are necessary, so no new installation commands are needed. You will be updating the Python classes to simulate more\
    \ complex, realistic interactions as per the requirements. Here is the code that needs to be written or modified to comply\
    \ with the additional user input:\n\nModify the `Farmer` class in **simulation/farmer.py**:\n```python\nclass Farmer(Agent):\n\
    \    # Existing code ...\n\n    def step(self, market_conditions, regulatory_conditions):\n        # Farmers adjust their\

    \ * regulatory_conditions.get(\"compliance_factor\", 1)\n        else:\n            # Non-complying farmers may produce\
    \ more, but risk penalties\n            adjusted_production_capacity = self.production_capacity\n\n        demand = market_conditions.get('demand',\

    \ compliance based on new regulatory conditions\n        # ...\n```\n\nModify the `Regulator` class in **simulation/regulator.py**:\n\
    ```python\nclass Regulator(Agent):\n    # Existing code ...\n\n    def step(self, market_conditions):\n        # Regulators\
    \ influence market conditions through policy decisions\n        # This can include changing demand, price, or implementing\

    \ compliance_factor,  # effects on production based on compliance\n            # More policy effects as needed\n     \
    \   }\n```\n\nModify the `SimulationEngine`'s `step` function in **simulation/simulation_engine.py** to use updated agent\
    \ `step` methods:\n```python\nclass SimulationEngine:\n    # Existing code ...\n\n    def step(self):\n        if not\

    \        return regulatory_conditions\n```\n\nAfter modifying the Farmer and Regulator classes and their interaction in\
    \ the SimulationEngine, ensure to test the simulation to verify the behaviors are correct.\n\nIn the interest of keeping\
    \ file sizes small, break down large files if they exceed 50 lines of code. For example, you may find that class definitions\
    \ and related functions for Farmers and Regulators grow too large for **farmer.py** and **regulator.py**, in which case\
    \ you would refactor the code into separate files, such as **farmer_behaviors.py** and **regulator_policies.py**. These\
    \ would contain the specific methods or strategies that characterize different agent behaviors."
