  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

    # ABM: Agent-Based Model


    ## Overview

    ABM is a simplified simulation tool designed to model the South African cannabis and hemp industry dynamics using an agent-based
    approach in Streamlit. The model features two agent types: Farmers (both formal and informal) with attributes like production
    capacity and compliance status, and Regulators, influencing the market by policies. This simulation aims to help understand
    how these entities interact over a fixed period.


    ## User Guide

    Users interact with the ABM simulation through a Streamlit interface to:

    * Input market demand and regulatory conditions.

    * Control the simulation with start, stop, and reset functionalities.

    * Observe the outcomes through visualizations of production and compliance levels.


    ## Installation & Running the Simulation

    1. Clone the repository.

    2. Install the required libraries: Streamlit, Python, Pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and altair.

    3. Run the `streamlit run streamlit_app.py` command in your terminal to initiate the interface.


    ## Features

    * Interactive Streamlit UI for input parameter configuration.

    * Start, stop, and reset controls for the simulation.

    * Graphical representations for viewing simulation outputs.


    ## Development and Contribution

    The codebase adheres to clean-coding principles and is well-documented to facilitate contributions. Developers should
    refer to in-code comments and docstrings for guidance. Contributions towards expanding the ABM''s features and scalability
    are welcome.


    For developers, please ensure you:

    * Maintain the coding standards as per the documentation.

    * Update the README.md and CHANGELOG.md as appropriate for new features or bug fixes.

    * Add unit tests for new code to ensure reliability.


    ## Technical Architecture

    ABM runs a Streamlit application (`streamlit_app.py`) that includes user input collection, control buttons, and output
    placeholders separated into modular Python files. The simulation logic is encapsulated in `simulation_engine.py`, iterating
    over the various agent classes such as `farmer.py` and `regulator.py`.


    ## Project Structure

    The project comprises several modules:

    * `/streamlit_app.py`: The entry point for the Streamlit application.

    * `/interface`: Modules for the user input, control buttons, and outputs display.

    * `/simulation`: Core modules for the agent-based model, including agent definitions and the simulation engine.

    For questions, suggestions, or contributions, please open an issue in the repository, and a maintainer will get back to
    you.

    This simulation is a basic model and may not account for all real-world dynamics of the South African cannabis and hemp
    industry. It is intended for educational and research purposes only.

    (Updated Section)

    - Regulatory Conditions: Choose between ''Lenient'', ''Strict'', or ''Custom'' to determine the stringency of regulations
    in the simulation. ''Custom'' allows setting a specific compliance factor that affects farmer production.

    ```


    Now, implement the new changes into the previously implemented file and return the entirely coded file. Do not add any
    lines of code that are not in the previously coded file or the new implementation but only combine those two.


    **IMPORTANT**

    All lines of code in the new implementation should be present. From the old implementation, only take the ones that are
    replaced with the comment `[OLD CODE]` in the new implementation


    **IMPORTANT**

    Make sure that you respond with all lines of code that are replaced by these comments, including all control structures,
    error handling, and any other relevant logic that was in the original code.

    Under no circumstances should you ever leave any part of the code snippet unwritten. Every single line of code that exists
    in the place where the comment lives right now should be replaced. Do not include any code that is above or below the
    comment but only the code that should be in the position of the comment.'
