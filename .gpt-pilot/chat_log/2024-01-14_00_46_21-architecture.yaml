  content: 'You are working in a software development agency and a project manager approached you telling you that you''re
    assigned to work on a new project. You  are working on a App called "ABM" and you need to create specifications on what
    technologies should be used in this project.


    Here is a high level description of "ABM":

    ```

    Development of a Basic Agent-Based Model (ABM) named "ABM" will be undertaken to simulate the South African cannabis and
    hemp industry using Streamlit. This basic version will feature two types of agents: Farmers (formal and informal) with
    attributes like production capacity and compliance status, and Regulators who affect market conditions and policies. The
    interactions will allow Farmers to respond to market conditions and Regulators to implement policies.


    The simulation will run over a timeframe of two years per execution and is designed for a single user without support
    for multiple simultaneous users. The Streamlit interface will enable user input for parameters such as market demand and
    regulatory conditions through sliders or input fields. Users can control the simulation with start, stop, and reset buttons.


    Data visualization will present results through graphs or tables, showcasing key outputs like total production and compliance
    levels. However, no feedback mechanism for user input is required for this application.


    Development guidelines include maintaining a clean, well-documented codebase, ensuring user-friendliness, and prioritizing
    quick loading and smooth interaction. Codebase documentation will consist of an overview, in-code comments, descriptive
    docstrings, a comprehensive README file, API documentation (if applicable), a change log or version control messages,
    testing documentation, deployment instructions, coding standards, and future development notes.


    The implementation does not require the collection of historical data input from users since default values for the simulation
    parameters will be provided, which users can adjust. Design should account for scalability for eventual enhancement with
    more complex features.

    ```



    Here are user stories that specify how users use "ABM":

    ```


    - User will input parameters for market demand and regulatory conditions using sliders or input fields in the Streamlit
    interface.


    - User will start the simulation by clicking the ''start'' button in the Streamlit interface.


    - User will stop the ongoing simulation by clicking the ''stop'' button in the Streamlit interface.


    - User will reset the simulation to initial conditions by clicking the ''reset'' button in the Streamlit interface.


    - User will observe the total production output through graphs or tables within the Streamlit interface.


    - User will assess compliance levels of the Farmers through visualizations in the Streamlit interface.


    ```




    Now, based on the projects details, think step by step and list the names of the technologies that will be used by your
    development team to create the app "ABM".

    Do not give any subjective thoughts or options, give exact technologies, for example:

    Instead of ["D3.js or other suitable charting library", "axios or other http client library"] answer with ["D3.js", "axios"].


    You do not need to list any technologies related to automated tests (like Jest, Cypress, Mocha, Selenium, etc) or  any
    technologies related to deployment (like Heroku).


    **Project Technology Guidelines**

    Relevance: Only include technologies that are essential and will be actively used in the project. Avoid mentioning any
    technologies that are not required. For example, don''t suggest MongoDB if database is not needed for project.

    Compatibility: Ensure that the listed technologies are compatible with each other. Exclude any technologies that cannot
    be integrated or used in conjunction with others. For example, Pandas (Python library) and Node.js can''t be used together.
    Another example is MongoDB (NoSQL database) and MySQL (SQL database) shouldn''t be used together unless that is specified
    in project description.

    Technology Preferences: In scenarios where multiple technology options are available for a specific project component,
    prioritize the following preferred technologies:

    - Node.js,

    - MongoDB,

    - PeeWee,

    - Bootstrap,

    - HTML,

    - CSS3,

    - cronjob,

    - Socket.io


    **IMPORTANT**

    Do not use, create or suggest any microservices. Create strictly monolithic application even if in some prompts I might
    suggest microservices might be better or more desired solution. Do your best to find a solution to any requirement without
    using microservices.'
