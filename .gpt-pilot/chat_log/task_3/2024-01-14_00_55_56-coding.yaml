  content: "You are working on a App called \"ABM\" and you need to create a detailed documentation for current state of project.\
    \ Your first task is to create README.md file.\n\nHere is a high level description of \"ABM\":\n```\nDevelopment of a\
    \ Basic Agent-Based Model (ABM) named \"ABM\" will be undertaken to simulate the South African cannabis and hemp industry\
    \ using Streamlit. This basic version will feature two types of agents: Farmers (formal and informal) with attributes\
    \ like production capacity and compliance status, and Regulators who affect market conditions and policies. The interactions\
    \ will allow Farmers to respond to market conditions and Regulators to implement policies.\n\nThe simulation will run\
    \ over a timeframe of two years per execution and is designed for a single user without support for multiple simultaneous\
    \ users. The Streamlit interface will enable user input for parameters such as market demand and regulatory conditions\
    \ through sliders or input fields. Users can control the simulation with start, stop, and reset buttons.\n\nData visualization\
    \ will present results through graphs or tables, showcasing key outputs like total production and compliance levels. However,\
    \ no feedback mechanism for user input is required for this application.\n\nDevelopment guidelines include maintaining\
    \ a clean, well-documented codebase, ensuring user-friendliness, and prioritizing quick loading and smooth interaction.\
    \ Codebase documentation will consist of an overview, in-code comments, descriptive docstrings, a comprehensive README\
    \ file, API documentation (if applicable), a change log or version control messages, testing documentation, deployment\
    \ instructions, coding standards, and future development notes.\n\nThe implementation does not require the collection\
    \ of historical data input from users since default values for the simulation parameters will be provided, which users\
    \ can adjust. Design should account for scalability for eventual enhancement with more complex features.\n```\n\n\nHere\
    \ are user stories that specify how users use \"ABM\":\n```\n\n- User will input parameters for market demand and regulatory\
    \ conditions using sliders or input fields in the Streamlit interface.\n\n- User will start the simulation by clicking\
    \ the 'start' button in the Streamlit interface.\n\n- User will stop the ongoing simulation by clicking the 'stop' button\
    \ in the Streamlit interface.\n\n- User will reset the simulation to initial conditions by clicking the 'reset' button\
    \ in the Streamlit interface.\n\n- User will observe the total production output through graphs or tables within the Streamlit\
    \ interface.\n\n- User will assess compliance levels of the Farmers through visualizations in the Streamlit interface.\n\
    \n```\n\n\nHere are the technologies that you need to use for this project:\n```\n\n- Streamlit\n\n- Python\n\n- Pandas\n\

  \ Model\\n\\n## Overview\\nABM is a simplified simulation tool designed to model the South African cannabis and hemp industry\
  \ dynamics using an agent-based approach in Streamlit. The model features two agent types: Farmers (both formal and informal)\
  \ with attributes like production capacity and compliance status, and Regulators, influencing the market by policies. This\
  \ simulation aims to help understand how these entities interact over a fixed period.\\n\\n## User Guide\\nUsers interact\
  \ with the ABM simulation through a Streamlit interface to:\\n* Input market demand and regulatory conditions.\\n* Control\
  \ the simulation with start, stop, and reset functionalities.\\n* Observe the outcomes through visualizations of production\
  \ and compliance levels.\\n\\n## Installation & Running the Simulation\\n1. Clone the repository.\\n2. Install the required\
  \ libraries: Streamlit, Python, Pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and altair.\\n3. Run the `streamlit run streamlit_app.py` command\
  \ in your terminal to initiate the interface.\\n\\n## Features\\n* Interactive Streamlit UI for input parameter configuration.\\\
  n* Start, stop, and reset controls for the simulation.\\n* Graphical representations for viewing simulation outputs.\\n\\\
  n## Development and Contribution\\nThe codebase adheres to clean-coding principles and is well-documented to facilitate\
  \ contributions. Developers should refer to in-code comments and docstrings for guidance. Contributions towards expanding\
  \ the ABM's features and scalability are welcome.\\n\\nFor developers, please ensure you:\\n* Maintain the coding standards\
  \ as per the documentation.\\n* Update the README.md and CHANGELOG.md as appropriate for new features or bug fixes.\\n*\
  \ Add unit tests for new code to ensure reliability.\\n\\n## Technical Architecture\\nABM runs a Streamlit application (`streamlit_app.py`)\
  \ that includes user input collection, control buttons, and output placeholders separated into modular Python files. The\
  \ simulation logic is encapsulated in `simulation_engine.py`, iterating over the various agent classes such as `farmer.py`\
  \ and `regulator.py`.\\n\\n## Project Structure\\nThe project comprises several modules:\\n* `/streamlit_app.py`: The entry\
  \ point for the Streamlit application.\\n* `/interface`: Modules for the user input, control buttons, and outputs display.\\\
  n* `/simulation`: Core modules for the agent-based model, including agent definitions and the simulation engine.\\n\\n##\
