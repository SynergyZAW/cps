# ABM: Agent-Based Model Simulation

## Overview
ABM simulates the South African cannabis and hemp industry through an agent-based model. Featuring Farmers and Regulators as agents, it explores their interactions within the market, responding to user-defined parameters.

## Getting Started
Clone the repository and ensure you have Streamlit and the necessary Python packages installed. Execute the program with `streamlit run streamlit_app.py`.

## Usage
The simulation allows input for market demand and regulatory conditions. Controls such as 'start', 'stop', and 'reset' enable the user to manipulate the simulation, which can be assessed through visual outputs.

## Features
- Streamlit interface with user input sliders or fields
- Control buttons to manage simulation
- Visualizations for production and compliance

## Development Guidelines
Developers should maintain a clean and well-documented codebase, with an emphasis on a user-friendly experience and performance. Contributions are encouraged to enhance the application's features and scalability.

## Technologies
- Streamlit
- Python with packages: Pandas, numpy, matplotlib, altair
- Git for version control

## Project Structure
ABM project is structured with the following key directories and files:
- `/streamlit_app.py`: Entry point with main application logic.
- `/interface`: Modules for user interfaces and controls.
- `/simulation`: Core simulation logic with model agents.
- `/visualization`: Visualization scripts for simulation output.

## Documentation
Detailed documentation is included in the codebase, featuring descriptive comments, docstrings, and a structured README to guide the user and developer experience.
